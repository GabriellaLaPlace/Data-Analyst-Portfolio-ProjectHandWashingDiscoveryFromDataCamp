# HandWashingDiscoveryProjectDataCamp
Hand Washing Discovery Project From DataCamp

To view the project click on the notebook.ipynb file. The other files are the database materials that were queried to get the results of the project.

The project is based on Dr. Semmelweis and the discovery of handwashing.

Steps in the project
1. A common separated values file holding yearly deaths by specific clinics is turned into a DataFrame and saved in the variable yearly. This is then printed.

2. The proportion of deaths per births is then found. The proportion of deaths per births at clinic1 is saved in the variable yearly1. After this, the proportion of deaths per births at clinic2 is saved in the variable yearly2. yearly1 (that holds the proportional deaths per births at clinic1 for different years) is then printed. 

3. Lines showing the proportion of deaths per births by year at clinic1 (yearly1) and clinic2 (yearly2) are plotted in the same graph.
